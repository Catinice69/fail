# fail
### Sometimes, Failing is the key to success. ###


#### - DISCLAIMER: ####
```
i am totally not responsible about what you do with this repo. You have full rights to do whatever you wish, but I will take NO Responsibility if your DroneCI account gets banned. If you blame it on me, I will laugh at you.
```

#### - How it works? ####

DroneCI has a mechanism to run failed builds with SSH access, after it fails. However, 99% Docker images are alpine (shitty af in my opinion) + do NOT have tmate and makes the feature totally useless.

Using a ubuntu docker and installing tmate and *forcing* the build to fail, users can manually trigger the build and then SSH into the server (and get access to that crazy shit spec server).


#### - Advantages of this repo ####

- ubuntu docker !

- prebuilt configs so you can quickly setup after ssh!

#### - How to deploy ####

- Setup DroneCI on your own account (ofc lol)

- Fork this repo

- Enable this repo in DroneCI

- Trigger the build
